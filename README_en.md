## Description

This repository contains laboratory works and practical assignments for the functional programming course in **Haskell**. The works cover the main concepts of functional programming from basic constructs to advanced abstractions.

## Tools

- **Language:** Haskell
- **Compiler:** GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

## Course Structure

The repository is organized by topics, each representing a separate section of the course:

### Basic Concepts
- **4_introduction** - Introduction to Haskell: basic syntax, recursion, higher-order functions
- **5_1_lists** - Working with lists: operations, list comprehensions, processing functions
- **5_2_types** - Data types: algebraic data types, type systems

### Type Classes and Their Implementation
- **6_standart_classes_realization** - Implementation of standard type classes (Eq, Ord, Show, Read, etc.)
- **7_semigroups_monoids** - Semigroups and monoids: algebraic structures in Haskell

### Functors and Applicatives
- **8_applicative_functors** - Applicative functors: applying functions in context
- **9_parsers** - Parsers: building parser combinators, working with Traversable and Foldable

### Monads
- **10_monads** - Monads: basics of monadic computations, do-notation
- **11_standart_monads** - Standard monads: Maybe, Either, List, State, Reader, Writer
- **12_monad_transformers** - Monad transformers: composition of monadic effects

### Advanced Topics
- **13_types_computing** - Type-level computations: GADTs, type families, phantom types
- **14_recursive_types** - Recursive data types: trees, graphs, fix-point combinators
- **15_zippers_lens** - Zippers and lenses: functional references, navigation through data structures

### Theory
- **0-3_theory** - Theoretical materials
- **lambda_calc** - Lambda calculus: basics, reduction, Church encodings
- **lectures** - Lecture materials

## Main Topics

As part of the course, the following were studied and implemented:

- ✅ **Functional paradigm**: pure functions, immutability, function composition
- ✅ **Lazy evaluation**: infinite data structures, thunks, optimization
- ✅ **Type system**: strong static typing, type inference, polymorphism
- ✅ **Algebraic types**: sum types, product types, pattern matching
- ✅ **Type classes**: Functor, Applicative, Monad, Foldable, Traversable
- ✅ **Monadic computations**: state, errors, non-determinism, IO
- ✅ **Parser combinators**: building parsers through composition
- ✅ **Advanced features**: GADTs, recursion schemes, zippers, lenses
- ✅ **Lambda calculus**: theoretical foundations of functional programming

## Practical Skills

- Writing pure functional code
- Working with monads and applicative functors
- Building combinators and DSLs
- Implementing complex algorithms through functional abstractions
- Using advanced features of GHC's type system
- Applying functional patterns to solve practical problems
